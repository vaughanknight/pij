# pij — agent-facing harness recipes.
#
# `just` is the canonical interface for agents. `npm run …` exists for
# direct script invocation and IDE integration, but the composite gates
# (self-check, vet, snapshots) live here so there is exactly one place
# to encode them. If you find yourself running multi-step npm chains by
# hand, the chain belongs in this file.
#
# See AGENTS.md § Self-improvement loop — encode, don't document.

# Default recipe: list available recipes.
default:
    @just --list

# --- atomic checks (thin wrappers over npm scripts) ---

typecheck:
    npm run typecheck

lint:
    npm run lint

# Auto-fix formatting + import order via Biome.
format:
    npm run format

test:
    npm run test

# tmux-driven end-to-end smoke (Driver SDK).
smoke:
    npm run smoke

# Manage third-party pi-extensions via .pi/packages.yaml.
pkg *ARGS:
    npm run pkg -- {{ARGS}}

# --- composite gates ---

# Pre-merge / pre-release gate. Agents MUST run this before reporting a
# task complete — never run npm directly to compose these steps.
self-check:
    just typecheck
    just lint
    just test
    just smoke
    PIJ_VET_SKIP_AGENT=1 just pkg audit
    just snapshots-check

# Refresh package-vetter __snapshots__/ via live minih agent runs.
# Opt-in: gated on PIJ_VET_SKIP_AGENT != "1". Not part of self-check.
snapshots-refresh:
    npm run snapshots:refresh

# Soft alarm — warns when briefing.md SHA drifts from snapshot _meta.json.
# Exits 0 always; informational. Wired into self-check.
snapshots-check:
    npm run snapshots:check

# Opt-in live regression for the package-vetter adapter.
# Requires a real Copilot session + spends API tokens.
vet-live:
    PIJ_VET_LIVE=1 npx vitest run agent.live

# --- ergonomics ---

# Scaffold a new T2 extension. Never hand-roll the boilerplate.
new NAME:
    npm run new -- {{NAME}}

# Symlink .pi/extensions/* into ~/.pi/extensions/ for autoload.
