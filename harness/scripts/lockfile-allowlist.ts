// Lockfile source-host allowlist — the compensating control for npmjs-scoped
// host replacement (PR#25 adopt, dove ruling s052-npm-hardening-pr25).
//
// The two-layer supply-chain model:
//   1. Reads: `replace-registry-host=npmjs` routes npmjs registry reads through
//      the Microsoft proxy (registry authority), and leaves the sanctioned
//      `minih` git+ssh dependency to resolve from its origin.
//   2. Lockfile integrity: THIS static check asserts every `resolved` URL in
//      package-lock.json points at an allowed source. Unlike the old
//      `replace-registry-host=always` — which silently *redirected* a crafted
//      URL to the proxy at install time (mute, and only where the .npmrc
//      applies) — this catches a tampered lockfile ITSELF, loudly, at CI/review
//      time, everywhere. Tamper-detection, not tamper-absorption.
//
// Any `resolved` host outside the allowlist is a HARD failure.
