// pij-control-plane — two-tier registry policy (plan 071 D1, T001).
//
// PURE. Decides whether a registry record belongs in the HOT tier (`~/.pij/*.json`,
// which the daemon tick scans in full every 600ms) or is ARCHIVABLE (moved under
// `~/.pij/archive/`, reachable only by keyed lookup).
//
// Why this exists: on 2026-07-25 ~2,000 dead descriptors made each daemon tick
// ~19s — the tick calls `registry.list()` six times, and every call is a readdir
// plus a JSON.parse of EVERY descriptor that has ever existed. Delivery waits for
// a tick, so tick cost is delivery latency. The invariant this module encodes is
// `tick cost = O(live)`: the hot tier holds live seats plus recently-terminal ones,
// and nothing else.
//
// The bias is deliberately conservative — archiving is a MOVE, and a wrongly
// archived live seat is a fleet outage while a wrongly retained dead one is only
// slow. So every "can't prove it" branch answers `hot`.
