/** Can this seat's card MISLEAD a reader if it goes stale?

 * it owed one. The asymmetry with `owesStatusCard` is the whole point: **the
 * consumer cannot tell who was obliged to write it.** A rotten card misinforms
 * identically either way, so a prime that VOLUNTARILY writes one has put itself
 * in the render surface and is held to freshness from then on — writing the card
 * is the act that creates the expectation.
 *
 * Not hypothetical: on 2026-07-30 a prime wrote a real card, let it rot 43min
 * past threshold, and was correctly flagged. A blanket role exclusion would have
 * left that unpoliced on the seat with the widest readership.
 *
 * DESIGNED ASYMMETRY WITH THE RAIL (ruled, spine 25457) — do not "reconcile" it:
 * chainglass renders a prime card's AGE but never applies the stale LABEL, while
 * this predicate keeps `pij anomalies` raising status-stale for the same seat.
 * Both are correct because the consumers differ. A row here is NOT an accusation
 * from above: a prime has no supervisor, so the only party who can act on it is
 * the prime itself running its own unscoped sweep. It is SELF-SERVICE signal —
 * nobody is nudged, nobody is chased, but the seat can see its own rot. The LABEL
 * is what would imply a watchdog obligation, which is why the rail withholds it
 * and this does not.
 *
 * `statusAt === undefined` means nothing renders, so nothing can mislead — that
 * is what makes the never-reported prime a non-event rather than a false positive.
 *
 * Note this is `prime || pm`, NOT `role !== null`. The predicate it replaced used
 * the latter, which let an explicitly-stamped `worker` through even though the
 * comment beside it claimed workers were excluded — a stamped worker's card
 * renders nowhere, exactly like an unstamped seat's, and the watchdog already
 * agrees (its eligibility gate is `pm || prime`).

	// anaconda's real row: NOW/NEXT plus an "updated 22h ago" age line, muted
	// rather than amber. So "a PA's card renders nowhere" — which an earlier
	// version of this comment asserted — is simply false, and `floating card` in
	// paLineageRefusal is literal.
	//
	// THE GROUND IS THAT A STALENESS LABEL IS WATCHDOG LANGUAGE, AND WATCHDOG
	// LANGUAGE IS A LIE WHERE NO OBLIGATION EXISTS. This predicate gates "that
	// card is rotten", which tells a reader someone is late. A PA owes no card
	// (Jordan, 2026-07-31), so nobody is late and nothing is owed — the same
	// reasoning that took primes off the card-obligation hook, extended.
	// Supervision is what makes an age MEANINGFUL: labelling a seat nobody
	// nudges does not remove a false claim, it swaps "this is current" for
	// "someone is chasing this".
	//
	// DO NOT RE-GROUND THIS ON RENDERING. Rendering is another repo's live
	// decision and will drift under this file: the consumer has deliberately
	// SPLIT `carriesStatus` (who OWES a card) from `hasOptionalCard` (whose card
	// RENDERS — prime|pa) precisely so the two cannot be re-welded, and an
	// earlier version of this comment welded them here, in a file that outlives
	// the memory of why. Obligation is checkable from inside pij; rendering is
	// not.
	//
	// RUNNING IS NOT MERGED, which is why the rendering ground would have been
	// doubly wrong: the consumer's PA-card fix is an UN-PR'd local commit
	// (0e6da0a9b). Jordan's dev server runs that working tree, so PA cards
	// render FOR HIM AND NOWHERE ELSE — pull main or clone clean and they
	// silently vanish. Any comment here asserting what renders is describing one
	// unmerged working tree.

 *  in only one is a guard that looks total. Takes the state AFTER the write
 *  would land, so it catches all three routes to a floating PA: stamping `pa`
