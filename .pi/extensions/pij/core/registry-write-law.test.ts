// THE WRITE-LAW ENFORCER (plan 071 review round 1, §1.2).
//
// Five lost-updates on the same law in three plans. Two of them — `stampSenderActivity`
// and `releaseIdentity` — were written by the very branch that was fixing the other
// three, while the law sat documented in a daemon module behind a docstring that
// said "every DAEMON descriptor write".
//
// The conclusion is not "document it better". It is that a rule with no mechanical
// enforcement is a rule that gets rediscovered by shipping the bug. This test is the
// enforcement: a NEW raw descriptor write outside the allowlist fails the build, and
// the failure message tells the author what to do instead.
//
// This is deliberately a source-shaped test. A behavioural test cannot see a writer
// that has not been written yet, and "has not been written yet" is exactly the case
// that has bitten five times.
//
// ── READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THIS FILE ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// THIS TEST IS A TRIPWIRE, NOT A PROOF. Everything below is a TEXT PROXY for the
// real question — "does this write set a contested field?" — and a text proxy will
// always have holes. Two were found by mutating the guard itself (review round 3):
// ES6 shorthand (`write({ ...latest, closeIntent })`) sailed through a `field:`
// pattern, and an authority matched ANYWHERE in the call text meant a PAYLOAD VALUE
// (`{ currentTask: "cli" }`) satisfied it. Both are closed. That does NOT make this
// complete, and a green run here is not evidence that no lost-update exists.
//
// THE LOAD-BEARING PROTECTION IS THAT `write()` MERGES BY DEFAULT
// (`core/registry-write.ts`, applied inside the adapter). A writer that reads none
// of this and declares nothing still cannot clobber another writer's field. This
// file only catches the careless case earlier and with a better error message.
//
// A second limit, worth knowing precisely: the raw-write allowlist above is
// FILE-LEVEL, and it allowlists `cli.ts`, `core/cli.ts`, `daemon.ts`,
// `core/session.ts` and `core/daemon/loop.ts`. NONE of the five historical
// incidents would have been caught by it — every one of them lived in an
// allowlisted file. The SET-side test at the bottom is the one doing real work,
// because it is file-agnostic: it asks what a write DOES, not where it lives.
