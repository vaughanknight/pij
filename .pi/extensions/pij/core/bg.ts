// pij-control-plane — background jobs that report themselves when they finish.
//
// PURE. Builds the job spec and the completion message; every side effect
// (spawning, writing, delivering) belongs to the caller's ports.
//
// Why this exists: an agent that shells out to a long command must either block
// its whole turn or poll. Neither is acceptable in a pushed-turn harness — the
// seat is idle-but-not-done, which is exactly the shape the watchdog derives as
// a stall. `pij bg` inverts it: the command runs detached and the RESULT arrives
// as an injected turn, so the agent's turn ends immediately and it is woken by
// the completion instead of waiting for it.
//
// The delivery is stamped `pij-bg`, not the caller. That is not a workaround for
// the E-SELF guard (`cannot send to yourself`) — it is the honest actor: the
// message genuinely comes from the runner, not from the seat that queued it.
// Same precedent as `pij-watchdog`, which injects turns the same way. The actor
// is a fixed literal and never caller-supplied, so this adds no spoofing vector.
