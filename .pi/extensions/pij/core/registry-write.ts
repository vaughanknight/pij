// pij-control-plane — THE REGISTRY WRITE LAW (plan 071 review round 1, §1.2).
//
// This lives next to the registry port, NOT in a daemon module, because the law
// is not daemon-specific — and pretending it was is exactly what let it be
// bypassed twice inside the branch that was fixing it.
//
// The incident list, verbatim from where each was learned:
//
//   #1  s054 Finding 04 — the node-truth denorms (`currentAssignment`/
//       `currentTask`/`semanticState`) are CLI-stamped between the daemon's
//       tick-start snapshot and its persist, so a daemon write replayed them away.
//   #2  s070 / #47 — terminal truth is stamped by the CLOSE path (`pij close` and
//       the in-process close), never computed by the daemon, and it is the
//       evidence the death reconciler classifies from. Leaving `closeIntent`/
//       `terminal`/`deathNoticeLatchedAt` unprotected made a pij-REQUESTED close
//       announce itself as `unrequested-by-pij`: close persists intent, kills the
//       pane, stamps `terminal: requested`, dissolves — then an overlapping tick
//       wrote its pre-close snapshot back over all of it, and the next sweep saw a
//       dead PID with no intent and no terminal. A lost update, not a missing check.
//   #3  s071 D7 — a buffered message reported as consumed destroyed the only
//       durable copy of an undelivered message.
//   #4  s071 D3 — `stampSenderActivity`, a CLI-side read-modify-write.
//   #5  s071 D4 — `releaseIdentity`: the widest window yet (two unlinks between
//       read and write) AND a `writeAtomic` that bypassed the dissolved-tombstone
//       guard, resurrecting a tombstone as an unreconcilable `pending` zombie.
//
// #4 and #5 were written by the branch fixing #1-#3, while the law sat documented
// behind a docstring reading "every DAEMON descriptor write". A law that requires
// the writer to know it has now failed twice in twelve commits, so it is no longer
// a law the writer must find: `RegistryPort.write` MERGES BY DEFAULT, inside the
// adapter, at zero extra I/O (that read already happens for the tombstone guard).
// The sixth writer is safe having read none of this.
//
// ── The framing trap (and why these are NOT "externally owned" fields) ─────────
//
// The original lists were daemon-centric: "externally owned" meant "not owned by
// the daemon". The moment `write()` merges for EVERYONE, that framing inverts and
// becomes a lost-update in the opposite direction — the CLI *owns*
// `currentAssignment`/`currentTask`/`semanticState`, so a symmetric merge would
// make the CLI re-read its own field from disk and drop the value it just computed.
//
// So the law is stated as PER-FIELD OWNERSHIP: every contested field has exactly
// ONE writer. On any write, fields owned by someone OTHER than the declared writer
// come from disk; fields the writer owns win. A writer that declares nothing owns
// nothing, which is the safe default — it refreshes its own uncontested fields and
// can never clobber a contested one.

 *  OTHER writers' data: you cannot clobber a contested field. It is SILENTLY LOSSY
 *  FOR YOUR OWN: any contested field you are trying to SET is discarded whenever
 *  disk already holds a value for it, with no error and no log line. If your write
 *  carries a contested field ON PURPOSE, you MUST declare the authority that owns
