// s099 — the pij_send registration schema must express message XOR command
// STRUCTURALLY, not only in the runtime guard (pij#166).
//
// Own file, not index.test.ts: that spec is a shared surface (fleet partition
// category 4) and this stream owns only the pij_send registration schema.
//
// ONE CRITERION, ONE CLAIM, ONE OBSERVABLE. Each behavioural test carries a
// single claim-bearing assertion and NO preceding setup assertion — a pre-fix
// red proves only the first assertion that fired, and a setup assertion in
// front of the claim promotes a precondition to evidence.
//
// Deliberately NOT a whole-object toEqual over the schema: that is one fat
// assertion proving "the object differs" without identifying which field —
// evidence narrowed by conflating rather than by aborting.
//
// SCOPE LIMIT, stated because it is the whole of pij#166: these assertions
// observe the REGISTRATION BOUNDARY. They cannot prove what the model is
// shown. See docs/plans/099-send-tool-xor/assets/union-spike.md — C1 is
// discharged only by observing a live seat's rendered tool definition.
