// pij-control-plane — per-harness Enter-settle rule (task #24).
//
// The bug: the daemon waited a single Claude-tuned 350ms before pressing Enter,
// so a Copilot send had its Return swallowed mid-debounce and the message stranded
// in the composer. The fix makes the settle harness-specific. These tests pin the
// rule itself (pure, no live pane); the Dim-0 anchor is "copilot > claude" — flatten
// the table back to one value and these go RED.
