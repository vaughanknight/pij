# Store-native governance — the ruled default

**Ruling (Jordan, 2026-07-18)**: no engineered migrations. Fresh primes govern in
the pij platform store natively from day zero; existing primes **self-migrate
lazily** at seat-change or skill-refresh — each carries its own load-bearing
facts into the store as it works. Prose government stands as historical record;
a prose-governed repo keeps prose as the live surface until ITS prime migrates.

## The mapping — prose artifact → store surface

| Prose (legacy) | Store verb (attributed, append-only) |
|---|---|
| spine.md Event paragraph | `pij spine append --kind <kind> [--project <slug>] [--refs <seq,seq>] [--actor <label>]` |
| prime-flow.json portfolio node | `pij project create "<description>"` then `pij project set <slug> [--plan <path>] [--prime <id>]` |
| roster / assignment rows | `pij task set <id> "<task>" --project <slug>` · `pij state set <id> <state> [--actor <label>]` |

**Always pass `--project` on `task set`**: the assignment carries the slug and
every later state-set/state-verified event inherits it — omit it and the
claim/verify lifecycle is silently orphaned from the project's filtered spine.
| verification of done | `pij state verify <id> --actor <verifier>` — done is a CLAIM until a **different** actor verifies |
| seat/liveness truth | `pij tree --json` · `pij node show <id> --json` · `pij anomalies --json` (surface, never act) |
| human-readable spine | `pij spine render` (deterministic md from the store) |

Read-back: `pij spine events [--since <seq>] [--project <slug>] [--peer <id>]`,
`pij project list|show <slug>`.

## Store facts to respect

- **Events are kind-coded records, not prose.** No body field exists. Narrative
  belongs in briefs/plan docs on disk (pointer delivery unchanged); link the
  record via `--project` and `--refs`. Refs take free-form pointer strings —
  convention: prior event seqs, `commit:<sha>`, `pr:<n>`, `path:<repo-relative>`
  — so a ruling/ship event CAN carry its on-disk pointer.
- **Append is immediate and irreversible** — no dry-run; a bare
  `spine append --kind x` writes at once. A mistaken event is never deleted:
  append a correcting event that `--refs` it.
- **Attribution is mandatory and honest** — omit `--actor` and the store records
  your seat id; never write as `"operator"`.
- Platform `seq` is store-allocated. Never encode your own ordering into it.

## Event-kind palette (recommended, not enforced — o-prime ruling 2026-07-18)

`kind` is open vocabulary (WS-5), but cross-prime queryability erodes when
primes coin near-synonyms (live census: ~30 kinds where
verify/report-verified/review-verdict/phase-approved all meant "verified").
**Reach for a CORE kind before coining one; coin freely only for a genuinely
new act.**

Core: `ruling` (o-prime decision) · `grant` (authority/baton/resume) ·
`ship` (landed to main) · `deploy` (machine-wide activation step) ·
`verify` (independent verification passed) · `finding` (routed dogfood/review
finding) · `blocker` (recorded impediment) · `transition` (stream/seat state
change) · `note` (governance telemetry).

Append is irreversible — no junk kinds (a stray `x` is permanent); correct a
mis-kinded event with a `--refs` correction, never a delete.

## Day-zero (fresh prime)

Replace the prose scaffold (bootstrap §3) with: one `pij project create` per
human-named portfolio item + `project set` for plan path and prime; thereafter
append a spine event at every governance act (grant, transition, ruling
pointer, teardown). Briefs/canaries stay as files. Everything else in bootstrap
(seat proof, per-repo contract, orient stack, intake) is unchanged.

## Self-migration at seat-change (the lazy rule)

**Migrate-as-you-touch, never bulk-backfill.** When the incoming seat first
needs a fact — an active stream, a baton hold, a pending decision — it creates
that fact's store record (project / spine event / task+state), then acts on it.
Facts nobody touches stay prose-historical; that is correct, not a gap. Mark
migrated prose sections with a pointer line to the store record; never erase.
